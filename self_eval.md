# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

**I am forgetting to add commas in some areas. Hopefully, I will learn from that mistake soon. Otherwise, the array holding the two hashes took me a minute to parse.**

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

**Typically I'm taking notes after class when I go review consepts or commands I know I do not have memorized. I believe right now that it is reinforcing these things in my mind.**

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

**I try to see if I have made a mistake first and if I can find it. Once I do, I can either fix it immediately, puzzle it out for a few mintues, and then if I either can't figure it out, or if it's being caused by something I have not seen, then I utlilize Google with the information I have.**
